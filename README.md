Extract pretrained CNN features for image clustering

## Dataset
The listed dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). There's 25000 images in the original dataset. Of course, we don't want to blow up Github, so only 30 pictures each of dogs and cats were uploaded, just so you can get started. Obviously, you can substitute your own dataset.
