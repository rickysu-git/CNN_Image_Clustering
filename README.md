Extract pretrained CNN features for image clustering

## Dataset
The listed dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). There's 25000 images in the original dataset. Of course, we don't want to blow up Github, so only 100 pictures each of dogs and cats were uploaded, just so you can get started (that should be good enough to get an accuracy of >0.90. Obviously, you can substitute your own dataset.
